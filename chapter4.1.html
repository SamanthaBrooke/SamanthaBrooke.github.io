      <p>In 1945 in Manhattan, a series of events took place which can be considered particularly significant in the social history of print. On June 30, a <a href="https://archive.org/details/17DaysTh1945">newspaper delivery drivers’ strike </a> broke out in New York, which was to last for 17 days. A documentary funded at the time by the newspaper publishers’ association showed what happened when thirteen million New York citizens were suddenly unable to buy their favourite newspaper. An early response to this development was that the radio stations doubled their news schedules, with programmes every hour, twenty-four hours a day.<span class="number">22</span></p>

        <p>On the other hand, many newspaper customers reacted to the strike by phoning the newspapers, who reassured them that they were still being published daily, and that people could still obtain a copy by going themselves to the newspapers’ printing presses, which loyal customers started doing. On the first day of the strike, circulation of the Herald Tribune plummeted to 15,000 copies, but after a massive word-of- mouth campaign, circulation was back up to 65,000 copies by the last day of the strike, by far the greater portion of them in direct over the counter sales. The Tribune readers have taken the time and trouble to come far out of their way to get a copy of their favourite morning newspaper.<span class="number">23</span></p></p>

        <p> Other major newspapers of the period, such as the New York Sun and the New York World Telegram, also saw hundreds of customers waiting patiently outside their respective presses, in orderly queues up to 17 blocks long, for as much as two to three hours.</p>

        <p></p>

      <div class="rightmaintext">
      <p> It seems people preferred the physical and delayed enjoyment of the printed word above the real-time radio signal, to the extent that thousands of customers were ready to spend a great deal of time and energy just to obtain their copy, instead of simply switching on the radio and waiting for the latest news update to come in through the ether.Once again dramatic proof has been given that no other medium can take the place of newspapers in the lives of the people.<span class="number">24</span></p>

          The New York times still offer a printed newspaper, but also offer an international online paper for purchase.
