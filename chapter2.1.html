              <p>It is this idea of electronic books that will "never be published in printed form," that brings us to the notion of the internet and the capacity for online publishing, including online <a href="http://blogbasics.com/what-is-a-blog/">blogging.</a></p>

              <p>The economic implications of web publishing are obvious by now, as is the speed with which the transfer and exchange of ideas is happening. Over the past few years, this tendency has increased with blogging. Even such established media outlets as The New York Times are requiring their reporters to blog constantly during the day; the paper that arrives on your doorstep each morning is hopelessly out of date; it's truly yesterday's news.<span class="number">11</span></p>


              <p>Like publishing or academic affiliation, blogging creates another type of community: peer-based consensus garners credibility. Blogging opens up instantaneous discourse with a group of like-minded thinkers. We all know of colleagues who post chapters-in-progress of their latest books on their blogs. Older proprietary ways of thinking would condemn this practice with the fear that your ideas would be swiped, brought too quickly to the marketplace. On the contrary, what happens is the opposite. By showing your commitment to these ideas publicly, they are acknowledged by a given community as being yours. If it's available to the whole world, then anyone trying to swipe your ideas will be outed by the public knowledge that you're the one who has been working on this subject. Academic bloggers find that their community of readers often act as fact-checkers or engage the blogger in instantaneous debate over specific points before the book reaches the concretized state of print.<span class="number">12</span></p>

            <p> In regards to the notion of online publishing rights, the issue of copyright is often called into question.</p>

            <p> The <a href="http://andpublishing.org/PublicCatalogue/PCat_thumbs.php">Piracy Project.</a> is an international publishing and exhibition project exploring the philosophical, legal and practical implications of book piracy and creative modes of reproduction. Through an international call for contributions The Piracy Project has gathered a collection of more than one hundred modified, appropriated and copied books from artists across the world. The collection, which is catalogued online, is the starting point for talks and workgroups around the concept of originality, the notion of authorship and politics of copyright.<span class="number">13</span></p>
