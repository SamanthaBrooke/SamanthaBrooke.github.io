              <p>The way that we are able to publish now days, calls into question how technology has violently altered printed books in a way from which there is no return. We are so disconnected from the means of production that nobody seems to be aware that books are produced very differently then they were 100 years ago. Digital files are exchanged between writers, publishers and printers all over the world.<span class="number">14</span></p>

               <p> So should we be defending technology and e-books, noting them as a viable and improved evolution? Or is this seemingly retrograde, given the essence of book production has been altered so dramatically?</p>

              <p>“Maybe nobody will care about printed books 50 years from now, but I do. When I read a book, I’m handling a specific object in a specific time and place. The fact that when I take the book off the shelf it still says the same thing - that’s reassuring… and he goes on … Someone worked really hard to make the language just right, just the way they wanted it. They were so sure of it that they printed it in ink, on paper. A screen always feels like we could delete that, change that, move it around. So for a literature-crazed person like me, it’s just not permanent enough.”<span class="number">15</span></p>
