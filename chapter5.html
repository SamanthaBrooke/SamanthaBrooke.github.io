        <p>After the age of radio, the next technology to make its appearance in the media arena was television, with its unique, hypnotic, reality-like video streams. For our society, this was a culmination of the electric revolution that had begun with the telegraph. Television was a new medium in real time, and until the late 20th century it remained the most pervasive and predominant of all media.</p>
        <p>The mass scale achieved by television in the 1960s gave it an unassailable position in all industrialised nations, reflecting the emerging ‘global village’ through an electric distribution of information – in striking contrast with the centuries-old model of the physical printed page, which seemed unable to compete because of its physical limitations.</p>
        <p>The shared feeling of ‘global interconnectedness’ through a real-time video transmission was something the printed page had never been able to provide. At this point in history, as a fascination with speed and progress was transforming people’s perception of time and space, the printed medium seemed simply too slow to allow information to be simultaneously diffused and consumed.<span class="number">25</span></p>

        <p>Marshall McLuhan’s seminal analysis of a new media-innervated world, is based upon an analysis of the various (mass) media and their changing roles in a new society which had evolved from industrial-physical relationships to an information-media relationship.</p>

        <p>“The term ‘communication’ has had an extensive use in connection with roads and bridges, sea routes, rivers, and canals, even before it became transformed into ‘information movement’ in the electric age. Perhaps there is no more suitable way of defining the character of the electric age than by first studying the rise of the idea of transportation as communication, and then the transition of the idea from transport to information by means of electricity.”<span class="number">26</span></p>
