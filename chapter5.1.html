              <p> The types of interaction made possible by paper are not yet available through new technologies, nor vice-versa, for that matter. There is still no electronic device which reproduces all the characteristics of paper: being lightweight, foldable, manipulable according to various reading activities, easily shareable with a small group of people interacting with each other simultaneously using a single medium, and being able to easily contain very different types of content, all instantly generated by hand, or juxtaposed with prepared (reproduced) content.<span class="number">7</span></p>

              <p>The ‘readability’ of paper seems very important to us: most people still choose to print a long document and read it on paper, rather than read it on a screen. So not only did the paperless office fail to happen, but the production and use of paper, both personal and work-related, and generally speaking the printed medium, have actually increased in volume. Paradoxically, paper has even significantly contributed to spreading the culture and consciousness of the new media. Paper is persistent, as is the ink printed upon it. Printed paper stays around for a very long time, and its content doesn’t change at the click of a button. Furthermore, we have the experience of a few thousand years of practice in reading externally illuminated paper. So again, the question is, what’s wrong with paper?<span class="number">7</span></p>
