        <h2> NEWSPAPAER DELIVERY STRIKE,  <br> NEWSPAPERS PREVAIL? </h2>

        <br><br><br><br>

        <div class="left">

      in 1945 in Manhattan, a series of events took place which can be considered particularly significant in the social history of print. On June 30, a newspaper delivery drivers’ strike broke out in New York, which was to last for 17 days. A documentary funded at the time by the newspaper publishers’ association showed what happened when thirteen million New York citizens were suddenly unable to buy their favourite newspaper. An early response to this development was that the radio stations doubled their news schedules, with programmes every hour, twenty-four hours a day. On the other hand, many newspaper customers reacted to the strike by phoning the newspapers, who reassured them that they were still being published daily, and that people could still obtain a copy by going themselves to the newspapers’ printing presses, which loyal customers started doing. On the first day of the strike, circulation of the Herald Tribune plummeted to 15,000 copies, but after a massive word-of- mouth campaign, circulation was back up to 65,000 copies by the last day of the strike, “by far the greater portion of them in direct over the counter sales. The Tribune readers have taken the time and trouble to come far out of their way to get a copy of their favourite morning newspaper. Other major newspapers of the period, such as the New York Sun and the New York World Telegram, also saw hundreds of customers waiting patiently outside their respective presses, in orderly queues up to 17 blocks long, for as much as two to three hours. It seems people preferred the physical and delayed enjoyment of the printed word above the real-time radio signal, to the extent that thou- sands of customers were ready to spend a great deal of time and energy just to obtain their copy, instead of simply switching on the radio and waiting for the latest news update to come in through the ether
	“Once again dramatic proof has been given that no other medium can take the place of newspapers in the lives of the people.”

Again, I'll use myself as a case in point. Nobody loved rummaging through used record stores like me. I have over 10,000 LPs to show for it and an equal number of CDs. For thirty-five years, most of my spare time was spent hunting down discs. But these days, I rarely open a gatefold of my beloved LPs and even more rarely do I crack a jewel case. Instead, I turn to my hard drive which is stacked with many more MP3s than my physical space can hold. And the thrill of the hunt remains: everything on my drive was procured through web-browsing or file-sharing.

And sharing is the operative word. I feel that my LPs are now only truly valuable (read: socially) when they are digitally transferred and shared. Otherwise they sit on my shelf, a slab of vinyl for the enjoyment of me and my three fetishist, nostalgic friends. My reel-to-reel and cassette tapes suffer a worse fate as the they literally degrade with each passing day. Businesses that are flourishing today like Netflix are finished; they use the web as an interface for distributing singular copies of material objects, but in failing to distribute the actual intellectual materials on the web, they are already doomed. See how different iTunes and its success is. Because they distribute digital content on the web, they are succeeding wildly. Obviously, given time and sufficient bandwidth, Netfilx and their competitors will migrate to the web. Again, iTunes knows that if it doesn't exist on the internet, it doesn't exist.
