        The English author Herbert George Wells is widely considered one of the spiritual fathers of science fiction (together with Jules Verne); his many works in the genre include such seminal titles as The War of the Worlds and The Time Machine. During the 1930s and 40s Wells appeared in regular radio broadcasts on the BBC, discussing “topics as diverse as world politics, the history of the printing press, the pos- sibilities of technology and the shape of things to come believer in the essential role of the printing press in bring- ing knowledge to ordinary people; in a 1940 discussed the importance of print for democracy, and how the ability to read and write enables us all to become “lords and masters of our fate”. And yet, only three years later during another broadcahe declared the newspaper medium to be “dead as mutton”. He denounced the excessive amount of power con- centrated in the hands of an unreliable press and the “prostitution” of the journalistic profession, which made it necessary to buy “three or four newspapers to find out what is being concealed from us”; he also jokingly advocated mass book burnings in order to rid local libraries of low-quality and out-of-date publications.

Again, I'll use myself as a case in point. Nobody loved rummaging through used record stores like me. I have over 10,000 LPs to show for it and an equal number of CDs. For thirty-five years, most of my spare time was spent hunting down discs. But these days, I rarely open a gatefold of my beloved LPs and even more rarely do I crack a jewel case. Instead, I turn to my hard drive which is stacked with many more MP3s than my physical space can hold. And the thrill of the hunt remains: everything on my drive was procured through web-browsing or file-sharing.

And sharing is the operative word. I feel that my LPs are now only truly valuable (read: socially) when they are digitally transferred and shared. Otherwise they sit on my shelf, a slab of vinyl for the enjoyment of me and my three fetishist, nostalgic friends. My reel-to-reel and cassette tapes suffer a worse fate as the they literally degrade with each passing day. Businesses that are flourishing today like Netflix are finished; they use the web as an interface for distributing singular copies of material objects, but in failing to distribute the actual intellectual materials on the web, they are already doomed. See how different iTunes and its success is. Because they distribute digital content on the web, they are succeeding wildly. Obviously, given time and sufficient bandwidth, Netfilx and their competitors will migrate to the web. Again, iTunes knows that if it doesn't exist on the internet, it doesn't exist.
