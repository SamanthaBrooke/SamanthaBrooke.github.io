          The pioneers in online magazine publishing were Salon magazine. In 1995, Salon launched the first major online-only magazine at http://www.salon.com. Like many print magazines, the site divides content into sections including entertainment, books, comics, life, news and politics, and technology and business. With an average of 5.8 million monthly unique visitors, this online magazine demonstrates the potential successes of Internet-based publications.

          Many other leading magazines have taken a similar step towards adapting to the digitisation of the modern world, by producing online editions of their magazines. The website, https://pocketmags.com/au capitalises on this by providing individuals with a host site, where they can store and access thier digital magazine downloads and subscriptions.

      Such advancements bring us to this quintesential question :

  <br><br>

<div class="rightbold">
      Is the death of paper apparent?
</div>

  <br>

      Will online magazines and newspapers abolish the once prominant hardcopy of the printed page?
