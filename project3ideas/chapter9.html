        <h2> ‘GO PAPERLESS’  </h2>

        <br><br><br><br>

      We can trace the actual expression ‘paperless office’ back to an ar- ticle titled The Office of the Future, published in Office. Besides predicting how computing giants (IBM and Xerox) would dominate the office market until the end of the century, this section looks into electronic methods of managing information which were expected to reduce, progressively but drastically, the amount of paper used in the working environment.

Starting in the early 1980s (the beginning of the age of personal information) this ‘paperless’ research-and-development mantra would increasingly become a propaganda buzzword aimed at creating a large target market for selling information technology (IT). Marketing departments actively promoted a vision of massive magnetic archiv- ing systems, destined to replace the huge amounts of messy paper, effectively de-cluttering the desktop once and for all. This meant a definitive shift towards systems of digital documents, existing only in windows on computer screens. But every IT user sooner or later experiences some substantial data failure – and this unavoidable ‘IT error’ paradigm effectively undermines any possible faith in an entirely digital model. Sellen and Harper deconstruct the ‘paperless’ propaganda, stating that:
“We have heard stories of paperless offices, but we have never seen one. (...) For example in one organization, managers banned the use of personal filing cabinets, only to find that people resorted to us- ing their car or home offices to store their paper files.” In fact, it should be noted that ‘paperless’ has remained a recurring propaganda theme ever since – promising to not only get rid of unwanted stacks of paper, but also (and perhaps more fundamentally) to reclaim physical space. But the types of interaction made possible by paper are not yet available through new technologies (nor vice-versa, for that matter). There is still no electronic device which reproduces all the character- istics of paper: being lightweight, foldable, manipulable according to various reading activities, easily shareable with a small group of people interacting with each other simultaneously using a single medium, and being able to easily contain very different types of content, all instantly generated by hand, or juxtaposed with prepared (reproduced) content. For example, the ‘readability’ of paper seems very important to us: most people still choose to print a long document and read it on paper, rather than read it on a screen. So not only did the paperless office fail to happen, but the production and use of paper, both personal and work-related, and generally speaking the printed medium, have actu- ally increased in volume. Paradoxically, paper has even significantly contributed to spreading the culture and consciousness of the new media. Paper is persistent, as is the ink printed upon it. Printed paper stays around for a very long time, and its content doesn’t change at the click of a button. Furthermore, we have the experience of a few thou- sand years of practice in reading externally illuminated paper. Since the 1990s, paper documents, rather than simply being supplanted by their electronic alter egos, are instead finding new ways to interact with them. So again: what’s wrong with paper?
