        <h2> THE ADVENT OF  <br> THE TELEVISION </h2>

        <div class="left">

        After the age of radio, the next technology to make its appearance in the media arena was television, with its unique, hypnotic, reality-like video streams. For our society, this was a culmination of the electric revolution that had begun with the telegraph. Television was a new medium in real time, and until the late 20th century it remained the most pervasive and predominant of all media. The mass scale achieved by television in the 1960s gave it an unas- sailable position in all industrialised nations, reflecting the emerging ‘global village’ through an electric (and thus instantaneous) distribu- tion of information – in striking contrast with the centuries-old model of the physical printed page, which seemed unable to compete because of its physical limitations. The shared feeling of ‘global interconnect- edness’ through a real-time video transmission was something the printed page had never been able to provide. At this point in history, as a fascination with speed and progress was transforming people’s perception of time and space, the printed medium seemed simply too slow to allow information to be simultaneously diffused and consumed

Again, I'll use myself as a case in point. Nobody loved rummaging through used record stores like me. I have over 10,000 LPs to show for it and an equal number of CDs. For thirty-five years, most of my spare time was spent hunting down discs. But these days, I rarely open a gatefold of my beloved LPs and even more rarely do I crack a jewel case. Instead, I turn to my hard drive which is stacked with many more MP3s than my physical space can hold. And the thrill of the hunt remains: everything on my drive was procured through web-browsing or file-sharing.

And sharing is the operative word. I feel that my LPs are now only truly valuable (read: socially) when they are digitally transferred and shared. Otherwise they sit on my shelf, a slab of vinyl for the enjoyment of me and my three fetishist, nostalgic friends. My reel-to-reel and cassette tapes suffer a worse fate as the they literally degrade with each passing day. Businesses that are flourishing today like Netflix are finished; they use the web as an interface for distributing singular copies of material objects, but in failing to distribute the actual intellectual materials on the web, they are already doomed. See how different iTunes and its success is. Because they distribute digital content on the web, they are succeeding wildly. Obviously, given time and sufficient bandwidth, Netfilx and their competitors will migrate to the web. Again, iTunes knows that if it doesn't exist on the internet, it doesn't exist.
