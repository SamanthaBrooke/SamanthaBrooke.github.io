          A uniquely futuristic vision of the changing mediascape was elaborated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave_Uzanne">Octave Uzanne</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Robida">Albert Robida</a> in their illustrated story "Contes pour les Bibliophiles", originally published in France in 1894. Octave wrote that as for the future of the printed page – “It will be abandoned”, except perhaps for some limited use in business and private communications. “The newspaper will go the same way”, since the printed word would no longer be satisfying compared to the new audio medium – and the thrilling experience of hearing the story actually being told. He concludes: “how happy we will be not to have to read any more; to be able finally to close our eyes”. The daily strain on the eyes from devouring news and essays, stories and novels, could at last be avoided as the ears absorbed the information, much faster and almost effortlessly.”For Uzanne, the death of print positively meant the end of a tyranny – the liberation from a debilitating slavery of the eyes.

Again, I'll use myself as a case in point. Nobody loved rummaging through used record stores like me. I have over 10,000 LPs to show for it and an equal number of CDs. For thirty-five years, most of my spare time was spent hunting down discs. But these days, I rarely open a gatefold of my beloved LPs and even more rarely do I crack a jewel case. Instead, I turn to my hard drive which is stacked with many more MP3s than my physical space can hold. And the thrill of the hunt remains: everything on my drive was procured through web-browsing or file-sharing.

And sharing is the operative word. I feel that my LPs are now only truly valuable (read: socially) when they are digitally transferred and shared. Otherwise they sit on my shelf, a slab of vinyl for the enjoyment of me and my three fetishist, nostalgic friends. My reel-to-reel and cassette tapes suffer a worse fate as the they literally degrade with each passing day. Businesses that are flourishing today like Netflix are finished; they use the web as an interface for distributing singular copies of material objects, but in failing to distribute the actual intellectual materials on the web, they are already doomed. See how different iTunes and its success is. Because they distribute digital content on the web, they are succeeding wildly. Obviously, given time and sufficient bandwidth, Netfilx and their competitors will migrate to the web. Again, iTunes knows that if it doesn't exist on the internet, it doesn't exist.
