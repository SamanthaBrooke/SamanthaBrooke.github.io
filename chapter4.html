        The English author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells">Herbert George Wells</a> is widely considered one of the spiritual fathers of science fiction (together with Jules Verne); his many works in the genre include such seminal titles as <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8909.The_War_of_the_Worlds">The War of the Worlds</a> and  <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2493.The_Time_Machine?from_search=true">The Time Machine.</a> During the 1930s and 40s Wells appeared in regular radio broadcasts on the BBC, discussing “topics as diverse as world politics, the history of the printing press, the possibilities of technology and the shape of things to come.” Wells was a passionate believer in the essential role of the printing press in bringing knowledge to ordinary people. In a 1940 broadcast he discussed the importance of print for democracy, and how the ability to read and write enables us all to become “lords and masters of our fate." And yet, only three years later, during another broadcast, he declared the newspaper medium to be “dead as mutton.” He denounced the excessive amount of power concentrated in the hands of an unreliable press and the “prostitution” of the journalistic profession, which made it necessary to buy three or four newspapers to find out what is being concealed from us. He also jokingly advocated mass book burnings in order to rid local libraries of low-quality and out-of-date publications.<span class="number">7</span>

        <p> Radio, on the other hand, enabled for the first time an essentially real-time mass-media distribution of information, which until then had been the exclusive domain of big newspapers using a completely different medium. Even beyond its dynamic delivery of content, radio created a sense of involvement, even a feeling of sensorial immersion:</p>

          So it seems that the potential of voice, as envisioned by Uzanne, was realised thanks to radio. In the 1940s, a period when radio was more popular than ever and still gaining momentum, newspapers nevertheless went on increasing their circulation. Customers seemed to enjoy the ritual of buying the morning (and often also the evening) editions from their favourite newsstands. And yet, during this period, the debate continued about how radio news was destined to inevitably supplant newspapers in the future.</p>

                The radio enables real time mass comunication on an audio level.
