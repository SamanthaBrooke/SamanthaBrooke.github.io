      <p>It’s not the computer itself which has forever changed the linearity of text – it’s the possibility, of entirely new text structure: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">the hypertext.</a>Starting in the mid-1980s, the arrival of offline hypertexts signalled a radical change, which was to have a profound effect on the concept of the literary work.
