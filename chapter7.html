      <p>It’s not the computer itself which has forever changed the linearity of text – it’s the possibility, through software, of creating in the abstract digital space a functional, entirely new text structure: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">the hypertext.</a></p>

      <p>Starting in the mid-1980s, the arrival of offline hypertexts signalled a radical change, which was to have a profound effect on the concept of the literary work. In fact, the hypertext enabled the realisation of an essential new characteristic: non-linearity of text.</p>

      <p>The consequence of this was a existential threat to the integrity of the sequential work, as it had been presented for centuries in books. And even though literature is still the main field for experimentation and innovation in print, the arrival of the hypertext enabled, perhaps for the very first time, a characteristic which could not effectively be reproduced in print.<span  class="number">33</span></p>




    <div class="rightmaintext">
      <p>American novelist and short story writer,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Coover"> Robert Coover,</a> clearly and authoritatively described this phenomenon in his seminal essay <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/27/specials/coover-end.html">The End of Books:</a></p>

    <div class="rightpullquote">
      <p> “Print documents may be read in hyperspace, but hypertext does not translate into print.” The superior form of the hypertext brings true freedom from the tyranny of the line.”<span  class="number">34</span></p>
    </div>


    <p>Coover belives that in the real world nowadays, that is to say, in the world of video transmissions, cellular phones, fax machines and computer networks, the printed medium is a doomed and outdated technology. It is a mere curiosity of bygone days destined soon to be consigned forever to those dusty unattended museums we now call libraries. Indeed, the very proliferation of books and other print-based media, so prevalent in this forest-harvesting, paper-wasting age, is held to be a sign of its feverish moribundity, the last futile gasp of a once vital form before it finally passes away forever.<span  class="number">35</span></p>

    <p>Much of the novel's alleged power is embedded in the line, that compulsory author-directed movement from the beginning of a sentence to its period, from the top of the page to the bottom, from the first page to the last. Of course, through print's long history, there have been countless strategies to counter the line's power, from marginalia and footnotes to the creative innovations of novelists like Laurence Sterne, James Joyce,and the form's father, Cervantes himself. It is only really possible, now at last, with the advent of hypertext. Written and read on the computer, where the line in fact does not exist unless one invents and implants it in the text.<span  class="number">36</span></p>
