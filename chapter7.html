      It’s not the computer itself which has forever changed the linearity of text – it’s the possibility, through software, of creating in the abstract digital space a functional, entirely new text structure: the hypertext. Starting in the mid-1980s, the arrival of offline hypertexts signalled a radical change, which was to have a profound effect on the concept of the literary work. In fact, the hypertext enabled the realisation of an essential new characteristic: non-linearity of text. The consequence of this was a existential threat to the integrity of the sequential work, as it had been presented for centuries in books. And even though literature is still the main field for experimentation and innovation in print, the arrival of the hypertext enabled, perhaps for the very first time, a characteristic which could not effectively be reproduced in print. Robert Coover clearly and authoritatively described this phenom- enon in his seminal essay The End of Books: “Print documents may be read in hyperspace, but hypertext does not translate into print” According to Coover, the ‘superior’ form of the hypertext brings “true freedom from the tyranny of the line”
