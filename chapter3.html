          <p> The development of public electricity networks, which enabled the mass distribution of new and revolutionary media, inspired visions of a radical change. The telegraph, introduced in the second half of the 19th century, was the first medium to enable the electrical transmission of content across long distances in real time. Despite a very low ‘bandwidth’ of just a few characters per second, this instant connection between faraway places completely changed the way people dealt with information, starting off the ‘electric’ wave of innovation which came to characterise the turn of the century.<p>

            <p>After the electric telegraph wire, the next step was the quest for the “speaking telegraph” and soon enough the first telephone networks were be- ing developed – first locally, then nationally and internationally. The ‘one-to-many’ mode of exclusive communication (introduced by the newspapers) was now being challenged at its very core, by the wires directly connecting voices between peoples houses; ultimately enabling a revolutionary means of communication.<span class="number">16</span></p>
