          The development of public electricity networks, which enabled the mass distribution of new and revolutionary media, inspired visions of a radical change. The telegraph, introduced in the second half of the 19th century, was the first medium to enable the electrical transmission of content across long distances in real time. Despite a very low ‘bandwidth’ of just a few characters per second, this instant connection between fara- way places completely changed the way people dealt with information, starting off the ‘electric’ wave of innovation which came to characterise the turn of the century. After the electric telegraph wire, the next step was the quest for the “speaking telegraph” and soon enough the first telephone networks were be- ing developed – first locally, then nationally and internationally. The ‘one-to-many’ mode of exclusive communication (introduced by the newspapers) was now being challenged at its very core, by the wires directly connecting voices between people’s houses.

Again, I'll use myself as a case in point. Nobody loved rummaging through used record stores like me. I have over 10,000 LPs to show for it and an equal number of CDs. For thirty-five years, most of my spare time was spent hunting down discs. But these days, I rarely open a gatefold of my beloved LPs and even more rarely do I crack a jewel case. Instead, I turn to my hard drive which is stacked with many more MP3s than my physical space can hold. And the thrill of the hunt remains: everything on my drive was procured through web-browsing or file-sharing.

And sharing is the operative word. I feel that my LPs are now only truly valuable (read: socially) when they are digitally transferred and shared. Otherwise they sit on my shelf, a slab of vinyl for the enjoyment of me and my three fetishist, nostalgic friends. My reel-to-reel and cassette tapes suffer a worse fate as the they literally degrade with each passing day. Businesses that are flourishing today like Netflix are finished; they use the web as an interface for distributing singular copies of material objects, but in failing to distribute the actual intellectual materials on the web, they are already doomed. See how different iTunes and its success is. Because they distribute digital content on the web, they are succeeding wildly. Obviously, given time and sufficient bandwidth, Netfilx and their competitors will migrate to the web. Again, iTunes knows that if it doesn't exist on the internet, it doesn't exist.
