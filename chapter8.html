      The death of paper<br>has yet to happen

<p>So the death of paper – in retrospect, one of the most unfortunate and embarrassing prophecies of the information age – has obviously not happened. Various kinds of printed pages are still being produced in huge quantities, and globally distributed, on a mass scale as well as on a very personal level. Nevertheless, the role of the printed page has radically mutated, from being a prevalent medium in its own right, to being a complementary medium, sometimes used as a static repository of electronic content.</p>

<p>The printed page has become more valuable, less expendable. This is because the duplication processes associated with paper are still limited and costly, and take up both space and time. Making a physi- cal copy of a book involves either reproducing it page by page – or printing it from a digital file, again page by page. The result is a stack of paper occupying a significant physical space, and space seems to have become one of the most valuable resources in our consumption- oriented age.</p>


<div class="rightmaintext">

<p>Electricity, radio, TV, computers and the World Wide Web have all affected, transformed and revolutionised the printed medium in various ways; still, our attachment to the particular characteristics of paper remains more or less intact.
Actually, paper and pixel seem to have become complementary to each other; print is increasingly the medium of choice for preserving the ‘quintessence’ of the Web. The editor of printed material is the curator, the human filter, the one who decides what should be saved on a stable medium, and what should be left as a message in a bottle tossed into the sea of the Internet.</p>

<p>So the printed page, with its sense of unhurried conclusiveness, allows to the reader to pause, to reflect, to take notes, without having to rely on electricity. And paper is also being used to preserve a substantial part of the digital culture, independently of hardware or software, describing the new media from the technical perspective of an old medium.</p>

<p>The death of paper, is essentially, a myth.
