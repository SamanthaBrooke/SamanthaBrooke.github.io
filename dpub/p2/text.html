			<h4> Tom's 28-Day Fast-Food Log</h4>
			<p>
 I am not afraid to let you see exactly what I ate on my fast-food diet. As you can see, I kept the carb count down only ordering fries here and there. I did not drink sugary soda at all, I do not like the stuff, and have not since I was a teenager. By doing this, I was able to enjoy a Carb Options fudge bar or two on most nights and still keep my calories and carbohydrates within my target range.

This is more of a modified Zone diet than a true low-carb diet. Normally I limit my carbs even more than this, but I was aiming for fast-food meals I think most people would be willing to try. Some people just can't bring themselves to give up starches completely.</p>
