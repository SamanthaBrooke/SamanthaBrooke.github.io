              <p> The types of interaction made possible by paper are not yet available through new technologies, nor vice-versa, for that matter. There is still no electronic device which reproduces all the characteristics of paper: being lightweight, foldable, manipulable according to various reading activities, easily shareable with a small group of people interacting with each other simultaneously using a single medium, and being able to easily contain very different types of content, all instantly generated by hand, or juxtaposed with prepared and reproduced content.<span class="number">31</span></p>

                    The Kindle e-reader was developed by Amazon.com in 2007, showing a clear attempt to replicate the experience of reading by electronic means.

              <p>The ‘readability’ of paper seems very important to us: most people still choose to print a long document and read it on paper, rather than read it on a screen. So not only did the paperless office fail to happen, but the production and use of paper, both personal and work-related, and generally speaking the printed medium, have actually increased in volume.</p>

                    The Kobo eReader is an e-reader produced by Toronto-based Kobo Inc. The company's name is an anagram of "book". The original version was released in May 2010.

              <p>Paradoxically, paper has even significantly contributed to spreading the culture and consciousness of the new media. Paper is persistent, as is the ink printed upon it. Printed paper stays around for a very long time, and its content doesn’t change at the click of a button. Furthermore, we have the experience of a few thousand years of practice in reading externally illuminated paper. So again, the question is, what’s wrong with paper?<span class="number">32</span></p>
