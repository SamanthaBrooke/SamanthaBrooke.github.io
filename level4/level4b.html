 		"Real growth often happens outside of where we intend it to."

	<h5> In the interstitial spaces, what Dr. Seuss calls the waiting place. Hans Ulrich Obrist once organized a science and art conference with all of the infrastructure of a conference. The parties, chats, lunches, airport arrivals, but with no actual conference. Apparently it was hugely successful and spawned many ongoing collaborations.</h5>

	<h5> Allow events to change you. You have to be willing to grow. Growth is different from something that happens to you. You produce it. You live it. The prerequisites for growth: the openness to experience events and the willingness to be changed by them.</h5>

<h5> Remember. Growth is only possible as a product of history. Without memory, innovation is merely novelty. History gives growth a direction. But a memory is never perfect. Every memory is a degraded or composite image of a previous moment or event. Thatâ€™s what makes us aware of its quality as a past and not a present. It means that every memory is new, a partial construct different from its source, and, as such, a potential for growth itself.</h5>
