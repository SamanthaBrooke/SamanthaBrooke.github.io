          <p>We can trace the actual expression <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperless_office">‘paperless office’ </a> back to an article titled The Office of the Future, published in Office. Besides predicting how computing giants <a href="https://www.ibm.com/au-en/">IBM</a> and <a href="https://www.xerox.com/">Xerox </a> would dominate the office market until the end of the century, this section looks into electronic methods of managing information which were expected to reduce, progressively but drastically, the amount of paper used in the working environment.<span class="number">27</span></p></p>

          <p>Starting in the early 1980s, the beginning of the age of personal information, this ‘paperless’ research-and-development mantra would increasingly become a propaganda buzzword aimed at creating a large target market for selling information technology.</P>

          <p>Marketing departments actively promoted a vision of massive magnetic archiving systems, destined to replace the huge amounts of messy paper, effectively de-cluttering the desktop once and for all. This meant a definitive shift towards systems of digital documents, existing only in windows on computer screens. But every IT user sooner or later experiences some substantial data failure – and this unavoidable ‘IT error’ paradigm effectively undermines any possible faith in an entirely digital model.<span class="number">28</span></p></p>

  <p><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.91.6538&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Sellen and Harper</a> deconstruct the ‘paperless’ propaganda, stating that:</p>

  <div class="rightpullquote">
    <p>"We have heard numerous stories and the proposed avantages of these paperless offices, but we have never seen one be realised. Paper is such a crucial element of the buisness environment which then poses the question: Is there really such a thing as the paperless office?"<span class="number">29</span></p>

<p>Some organizations have banned the use of personal filing cabinets, only to find that people resorted to using their car or home offices to store their paper files. In fact, it should be noted that ‘paperless’ has remained a recurring propaganda theme ever since – promising to not only get rid of unwanted stacks of paper, but alsoto reclaim physical space.<span class="number">30</span></p>

        What is wrong with using a good old filing cabinent? Why do people have such an issue with paper?
