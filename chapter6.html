        <h2> RADIO's ATEMPT TO  <br> STEAL NEWSPAPERS </h2>

        <br><br><br><br>

        <div class="left">

        Radio, on the other hand, enabled for the first time an essentially real-time mass-media distribution of information, which until then had been the exclusive domain of big newspapers using a completely different medium. But even beyond its dynamic delivery of content, radio created in many listeners a sense of involvement, even a feeling of sensorial immersion: “ ‘I live right inside radio when I listen. I more easily lose myself in radio than in a book,’ said a voice from a radio poll.”  So it seems that the potential of voice as envisioned by Uzanne was realised thanks to radio, “with its power to turn the psyche and society into a single echo chamber” (McLuhan, Understanding again, the predicted catastrophic consequences for the printed page simply did not happen. In the 1940s, in particular (a period when radio was more popular than ever and still gaining momentum) news- papers nevertheless went on increasing their circulation. Customers seemed to enjoy the ritual of buying the morning (and often also the evening) editions from their favourite newsstands. And yet, during this period, the debate continued about how radio news was destined to inevitably supplant newspapers.

Again, I'll use myself as a case in point. Nobody loved rummaging through used record stores like me. I have over 10,000 LPs to show for it and an equal number of CDs. For thirty-five years, most of my spare time was spent hunting down discs. But these days, I rarely open a gatefold of my beloved LPs and even more rarely do I crack a jewel case. Instead, I turn to my hard drive which is stacked with many more MP3s than my physical space can hold. And the thrill of the hunt remains: everything on my drive was procured through web-browsing or file-sharing.

And sharing is the operative word. I feel that my LPs are now only truly valuable (read: socially) when they are digitally transferred and shared. Otherwise they sit on my shelf, a slab of vinyl for the enjoyment of me and my three fetishist, nostalgic friends. My reel-to-reel and cassette tapes suffer a worse fate as the they literally degrade with each passing day. Businesses that are flourishing today like Netflix are finished; they use the web as an interface for distributing singular copies of material objects, but in failing to distribute the actual intellectual materials on the web, they are already doomed. See how different iTunes and its success is. Because they distribute digital content on the web, they are succeeding wildly. Obviously, given time and sufficient bandwidth, Netfilx and their competitors will migrate to the web. Again, iTunes knows that if it doesn't exist on the internet, it doesn't exist.
