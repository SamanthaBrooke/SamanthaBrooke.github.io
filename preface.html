          <p> In our present digital era, the ‘death of paper’ has become a plausible concept, widely expected to materialise sooner or later. It’s never easy to predict the future, but it’s completely useless to even attempt to envision it without first properly analysing the past. Looking back in history, we can see that the death of paper has been duly announced at various specific moments in time – in fact, when- ever some ‘new’ medium was busy establishing its popularity, while deeply questioning the previous ‘old’ media in order to justify its own existence. In such moments in history, it was believed that paper would soon become obsolete. Time and again, the established mass-media role of paper has been called into question by a number of media theorists and marketing experts, who attempted in various ways to persuade society at large to get rid of paper, and choose instead some newer and supposedly better medium. This ongoing process seems to have originated in the early 20th century, when the death of paper was predicted – probably for the first time – after centuries of daily use.<span class="number">1</span></p>

          Paper as a medium was first invented by the Egyptians around 3500 BC using the papyrus plant, then definitively established in China starting in the 2nd century CE.<span class="number">2</span>


      <div class="rightmaintext">
        The craft of papermaking spread throughout the world and remained a relatively small-scale, artisan activity until paper production became industrialised during the 19th century. Originally intended purely for writing and printing purposes, a dazzling array of paper products are available to today's consumer.<span class="number">3</span> The paper industry will continue to change and adapt to new market conditions, responding to consumer requirements, and moving closer to its vision of integrated sustainability and competitiveness.

        <p> A key concearn regarding paper in our present day, is sustainability, and the imact it has on our environment. Leaders in the paper industry are making a considered effort to reduce their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint"> carbon footprint </a> and clean up their buisness operations, in an attempt to reduce <a href="http://www.carbonfootprint.com/warming.html"> climate change </a> and also lower their financial costs. Over 20 years ago, it was thought that the paperless office (or close to it) would be a reality by 2011. Ironically, since then print volume has actually increased. Additionally, paper used for packaging, tissue products and newsprint demonstrate how prevalent paper usage is in daily activity.<span class="number">4</span>

        <p>The printed page, the oldest medium of them all, seems to be the last scheduled to undergo this evolutionary process of elimination. This transformation has been endlessly postponed, for various reasons, by the industry as well as by the public at large. And so the question may very well be: is printed paper truly doomed? Are we actually going to witness an endless proliferation of display screens taking over our mediascape, causing a gradual but irreversible extinction of the printed page?<span class="number">5</span></p>
