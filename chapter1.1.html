          <p>From scouring flea markets and eBay to maxing out their credit cards, record collectors will do just about anything to score a long-sought-after album. In Vinyl Freak, music writer, curator, and collector John Corbett burrows deep inside the record fiendâ€™s mind, documenting and reflecting on his love affair with vinyl. Discussing more than 200 rare and out-of-print LPs, Vinyl Freak is composed in part of Corbett's long-running DownBeat magazine column of the same name, which was devoted to records that had not appeared on CD.</p>

<p>Down Beat is an American magazine devoted to "jazz, blues and beyond", the last word indicating its expansion beyond the jazz realm which it covered exclusively in previous years.</p>

<p> Whilst the magazing is still published and widely distributed, the magazine takes advantage of the online capacity to publish, and each issue is now available to download online. </p>
